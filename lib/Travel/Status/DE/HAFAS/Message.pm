=head1 METHODS

=head2 ACCESSORS

=over

=item $message->short

Message header. May be a concise single-sentence summary or a mostly useless
string such as "Information". Does not contain newlines.

=item $message->text

Detailed message content. Does not contain newlines.

=item $message->code

Two-digit message code, seems to be only used with messages of type "A".
Details unknown.

=item $message->type

A single character indicating the message type.
The following types are known:

=over

=item A

Generic information about a specific trip such as "WiFi available", "air
conditioning", "DB tickets are not valid here", or "from here on as [line]
towards [destination]".

=item C

"Current information available", "Journey cancelled", "connection may not be caught", possibly more.

=item D

Large-scale disruption, e.g. medical emergency on line.

=item G

Platform change, possibly more.

=item H

Misc stuff such as "Journey contains trains with mandatory reservation" or
"ICE Sprinter".

=item L

Replacement journey

=item M

Free-text infos about construction sites, broken elevators, large events and
similar occasions.

=item P

Journey has been cancelled, possibly more.

=back

=item $message->ref_count

Counter indicating how often this message is used by the requested
arrivals/departures. ref_count is an integer between 1 and the number of
results.  If ref_count is 1, it is referenced by a single result only.

=item $message->is_him

True if it is a HIM message (typically used for service information), false
if not (message may be a REM instead, indicating e.g. presence of a bicycle
